# **ETL - Extract, Transform, Load**
	
## **Overview of Movies ETL Analysis** 
* Amazing Prime video is a platform for streaming movies and shows on Amazing Prime. Britta, a member of the Amazing Prime team has been asked for creating a dataset for the Hackathon. Britta needs to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. 
 
* Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.

* We will need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database
 


### Purpose 

* Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
* Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
* Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
* Create the Movie Database
